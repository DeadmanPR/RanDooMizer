### Note:
This program was made in Java. Therefore, you must have Java installed on your computer in order for this to work.

# Brief Overview
This program made in Java will randomize certain aspects of the video game Doom and its sequel, Doom II: Hell on Earth. Enemies, weapons, powerups and ammunition can all be randomized, with a random seed or a given seed. 

# Seeds
If the seed is given to the program, it will ensure that you always get the same random pattern (in other words, if 2 users use the same seed, they will get the exact same item locations and enemies).

# How to Use
There is an executable file included in this project, named RanDooMizer.jar. When you open it, it will prompt you to browse for the .wad file of your Doom game. After you open it, it will ask if the seed will be a custom seed, or if the program decides a random seed to use. The program will then ask what aspects do you want to randomize, and for which game it is (Doom or Doom II). If all went well, the program shall let you know.

The output of this program is a .wad file which is a modified version of the .wad file you opened with the program. The file will have one of the following:

- "Doom-" followed by some numbers (for example, "DooM-1234567.wad")
- For Doom II, "DooM2-" followed by some numbers (for example, "DooM2-1234567.wad")
